You can found the last version App [here](https://github.com/vincenzopalazzo/SpyJSBlock.react/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

At the moment you can not run the app from source because I'm refactoring it but you can run the version 1.0.0 at this [link](https://github.com/vincenzopalazzo/SpyJSBlock.react/releases/tag/v1.0.0), you can find my scheduler in the following TODO list

P.S: If you want try to compile the app, you should rename the file `package-old.json` to `package-old.json`. I make this change because github send me alert about the old dependence.
